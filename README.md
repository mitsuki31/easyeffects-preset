# EasyEffects Preset Collection

This repository contains my personal **EasyEffects** preset(s), crafted and tuned for daily usage across music, and media playback on Linux systems using [**EasyEffects**](https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects).

These preset(s) are specifically tailored to work with:
- PipeWire audio backend
- Real-time audio processing
- Various music genres and speech clarity

> [!NOTE]  
> These preset(s) are customized for my personal audio setup and preferences.
> You may need to tweak them to fit your hardware and environment.
> 
> I'm not your mom but consider using low volume when tweaking the preset or setting up on your own if using earbuds or headphone.
> Or you gonna blow up your ears in very rare case (that you will got a special achievement in your life).

It has been tested and perfectly fit for most music genres, including:
- EDM
- Pop (e.g., J-Pop, K-Pop and whatever pop genre)
- Rock
- Lofi (but maybe not considered perfectly fit, and you might to tweak them again)
- and more (_crazy enough wasting my time just for testing to all subgenres which I don't even know how much are them_)
